## Fizz Buzz Example in Java 8 using Jenkins Pipeline to publish Cucumber Reports

### Fizz Buzz is a game where
- if the number is divisible by 3, you say Fizz
- if the number is divisible by 5, you say Buzz
- if the number is divisible by 3 & 5, you say FizzBuzz
- if neither, you say the number

### Pre-requisite
- Add `Cucumber Reports` plugin in Jenkins to use `cucumber` DSL as shown 
in the `Jenkinsfile`

### Forked
-This project was forked just to be able to run it with jenkins on my personal machine, please follow the main repo (by TechPrimes) to be updated.
